### Project Goal

The main aim of the site is to give users a super-efficient way to locate an event or potential range of sports events, at the click of a button, to help plan a trip.

### User Stories:
 * As a user I want a simple, quick method of finding an event to attend.

 * As a user I want the page to be intuitive and easy to understand.  

 * As a user I want the site to tell me if I’m doing something wrong and how to fix it.  

 * As a user I want the site to be elegant and easy on the eye.

 * As a user I want the site to be responsive to different screen sizes so that I can still use the site whether I’m using my mobile phone, tablet or PC.

 * As a user I want the more advanced ‘filter’ options to be simple, obvious and intuitive to use.

 * As a user I want the results returned to be informative, concise, easy to view and read and relevant to my search request.

### Strategy Table
Features| Importance| Viability/Feasibility
------------ | -------------------------|---------
Provide a list of scheduled events | 5 | 5
Quick Search function  | 5| 5
Filter Buttons to narrow search parameters | 5 | 5
Responsive design | 5 | 5
Google Map showing location/s of listed results | 4 | 3
Hotels / Restaurants Section beneath map when map location clicked | 4 | 2

## Scope

It is unlikely that all of the features listed above can be implemented in time for initial deployment. The site will therefore be developed in three stages:

### Stage 1

The initial basic site takes user inputs and provides a table of up to ten events, in date order, for the user to view.  Pagination buttons allow the user to view additional results should the list returned be greater than 10 items.

### Stage 2

A google map is to be added in stage 2 with the locations of the listed events marked on the map.

### Stage 3
Details of restaurants, hotels and places of interest to be added below the map enabling users to better plan the trip and improve the travel experience.


<a name="structure"></a>
## 1.2. Structure
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

 - Site to be responsive on all Screen Sizes with information selectively added / removed dependent upon the screen size in use.
 - ‘Nav Bar’ section placed prominently at the top of the page to act as an initial prompt for first time visitors.
 - Hero image of a sports event beneath the Quick Search section, with a ‘Call Out’ describing and explaining exactly what the site does for the user.
 - ‘Filter Section’ provided beneath the Hero Image. Placed lower down the page to prevent distractions for new users.  Returning and frequent users will be acquainted with the site and thus more confident to move beyond the basic Nav Bar search option.
 - A ‘Results Table’ is displayed beneath the filter section, initially listing the current most prestigious upcoming events across the world.  The table to display ten results at a time, with ‘pagination buttons’ provided should a search bring back more than ten events.
 - ‘Google Map’ (Stage 2 development) to be listed below the Results Table marking the listed event locations on the map.  
 - ‘Local Attractions’ (Stage 3 development) to be listed beneath the Google Map.  
 - Footer section at bottom of page displaying social media links to various websites including Twitter, Youtube, Instagram and Facebook.

### Colours
Colours used are:

- #28a745 (Green) - used on buttons to compliment the grass within the Hero Image.
- #393837 (Charcoal Grey) - implemented within the Table Header to blend with the Filter and Table text and to tie in with the darker section of the Hero Image but with a softer shade to be easier on the eye.  Also provides a clear differentiation between the filter and table sections.


### Typography
- 'Exo' : used on the majority of the site to provide a mordern, positive feel.
- 'Play' : Filter Button font to provide contrast and interest against the Table section.

### Header Section
- Company Brand - placed prominently at top left.
- Quick Search Input Box - prompts users to search for a team or competition of interest.  Aids first time visitors providing an easy, intuitive first step.
- Quick Search button - highlighted in green for subconscious positive affirmation of use.
- Loading GIF - appears during initial page load whilst suggestions are loaded from the linked API - suggestions then populate the Quick Search Input Box to help the user with potential searches.

### Hero Image Section
- Emotive atmospheric image of a packed sports stadium used to invoke positivity, excitement and urgency.
- 'Call-Out' message both informs the user of the website's purpose whilst promoting immediate action.

### Filter Section

* Seven filter buttons provide the ability to narrow and refine searches between  :
  - Start Date
  - End Date
  - Sport

  - Competition
  - Country

* 'Start Filter' button - coloured green as per the Quick Search button to indicate positive use. Takes the input from the seven Filter Buttons and feeds the requirements to the 'PredictHQ' external API resource.

### Results Table Section

- Seven Columns provide pertinent information to the user based on the search criteria provided :
  - Event Title 	
  - Start Date 
  - End Date
  - Place Name	
  - Country	
  - Type	
  - Sub Type

- Results are provided 10 rows at a time.
- Pagination buttons are provided where the results yielded number greater than ten.  The user is able to move backwards and forwards as required.
- Each line is highlighted in green as per the previous buttons, both to standardise the colour scheme and, for Developments Stages 2 and 3, to indicate that the line can be clicked to highlight and zoom in on the Google Map location.
- 'Clear Filter' button : provides a simple, quick method to clear the filters ready for a subsequent search.

### Footer / Social Media Section

The bottom of the page provides standard / expected social media links to popular platforms including Youtube, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

# 4. Testing
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

## Automated testing

Screen responsiveness testing was carried out using Google Chrome's Developer Tools to ensure correct page loading on multiple devices including various mobile phone and tablet sizes.

### W3C Validator Tools

[W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) tool used to validate HTML code.

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) tool used to validate CSS style code.

[JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) used to verify Javascript coding (is unable to verfiy jQuery sections however).

## Manual Testing

* Site loads as expected on both Motorola and Sony mobile phone devices utilising the Android operating system, running the Chrome browser. 

* Site loads as expected on a PC utilising the Windows operating system.  Tested using Chrome, Firefox and Edge.  All load correctly and function identically.  On the Edge browser, however, the final column renders without any outline styling on those lines where the content is empty.  Does not affect functionality in any but doesn't look quite as nice as the Chrome/Firefox rendering.

* Site loads as ecpected on an 2016 iPad Mini utilitsing the Safari browser. The table results do not highlight green when tapped as per newer devices however. This may be due to the age of the operating system so needs investigation.

* Responsiveness :
  - The site is responsive to all break points and works as expected.
  
* Quick Search Input Box : 
  - 'Loading' message is replaced with prompt to type a team or competition as expected.  
  - Box loads with 250 event suggestions as expected. User can type as required, and either select from the filtered/remaining options or ignore as desired.

* Quick Search button :
  - Button works as expected. Results are retrieved from the API and displayed in a table between the filter and footer sections of the page.

* Filter buttons :
  - 'Start Date' button - tested and works as expected.
  - 'End Date' button - tested and works as expected.
  - 'Filter by Sport' button - when tested, this button works when used in conjunction with other search criteria but does not work by itself.  Time constraints have left the bug unresolved for the time being.  The button does load preset sport options as designed, from which the user can select/ignore/type their own input.
  - 'Team/Competitor' button - tested and and is not working at present. Time constraints have left the bug unresolved for the time being. Bug is suspected to be related to the 'search' string submitted to the API and is likely to be the same bug affecting the 'Filter by Competition' and 'Filter by City' buttons.
  - 'Filter by Competition' button - tested and is not working at present. Time constraints have left the bug unresolved for the time being.
  - 'Filter by Country' - tested and works as expected.  Preset country options load as designed, from which the user can select/ignore/type their own input.
  - 'Filter by City' - tested and is not working at present. Bug is suspected to be related to the 'search' string submitted to the API and is likely to be the same bug affecting the 'Team/Competition' and 'Filter by Competition' buttons.
  - 'Start Filter' - functions as expected. When clicked, the working search parameters are retrieved from the API and dsplayed in a table below the filter buttons.

- Table rows
  - Individual events highlight in green when selected on a touch screen or hovered over using a mouse.  Tested on a 2016 Apple iPad mini but this functionality was not present - possibly due to the age of the platform.

* Footer Links :
  
    - Facebook - When selecting the Facebook icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the Facebook website. It worked as expected.
    - Twitter -  When selecting the Twitter icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the Twitter website. It worked as expected.
    - YouTube - When selecting the YouTube icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the YouTube website. It worked as expected.
    - Instagram -  When selecting the Instagram icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the Instagram website. It worked as expected.

# 5. Development Cycle
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

- HTML  : Basic HTML framework was implemented first, following the layout created using the Wireframes. 

- CSS  : The Wireframes were used as a guide for the styling. Changes were made as development continued as it became apparent that some of the colours selected were too 'loud' and varied and therefore needed toning down a little.  

- Javascript : The Javascript segment has been by far the most challenging part of the development.  

  - API connectivty : it took some time to choose an appropriate API from which to export the data required.  Connecting to the API and understanding it's Endpoints was also a serious challange.  Roughly 10 days were spend experimenting with this process before an understading how to make things work became apparent.  The next challenge was to use Javascript to connect to the API.  I contacted the college (Code Institute) who advised to use a more modern method (Fetch) to connect with the data.  Again, it took several days to get this working, having first had to research the method using the educational web links provided by the college.  Perseverence won out and eventually got it working but at the cost of considerable time.

  - Quick Search' input box pre-load:  Retrieving multiple data results in order to pre-populate the 'Quick Search' box was, again, a considerable challange.  I needed the Javascript to both render a Table of Results as soon as the page loaded whilst simultaneously calling on the API on multiple occasions to load a large selection of potential events into the Quick Search box for users to choose from if required.  Getting the code to run without errors presented a number of problems which took many days and hours to iron out.  Taking the input from the box to produce a result was reletively straightforward thankfully.

  - Filter Buttons: The filter button inputs are used to generate a search string for submission to the API.  The time required to make previous features function properly left little time for resolving bugs and as a result a number of the buttons do not yet provide the required filtered results.  A Results Table is still generated, but is not norrowed down as much as is required.

# 6. Deployment
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

GitHub pages was used to deploy the project. The following process was followed:

1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Create a workspace in Gitpod.
3. Add/create files in Gitpod and push to Github following successive additions.
4. Go to Github respository, click on Github Pages and create a live website

<a name="known-bugs"></a>
# 7. Known Bugs
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

  - 'Team/Competitor', 'Filter by Competition' and 'Filter by City' buttons do not work at the present time.  

  - 'Results Table' does not always load first time. Page refresh resolves this issue and does not happen again after that.

  - Searching for a partial word/name in the Quick Search box does not yield any results. This is due to API constraints and requirements. A message advising as such to be added in a later update.

  - Table rows do not highlight in green on older Apple products.
